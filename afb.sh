# FORMAT BUMPS
#
# A format defines a range of OS versions that have compatible update metadata
# and content. An update client can update a system from the oldest version in
# the format to the latest version in the format without worrying about
# compatibility issues in the update content for the version it is updating to.
#
# A format bump occurs when the update metadata or content is changed in such a
# way that will cause client updates to break. In this case the format number
# must be incremented so clients will not attempt to update to the new versions
# in the new format without crossing the format boundary. Update clients update
# only to the latest build in their format. Once that update is complete the
# update client may then update forward again because the last version in the
# current format has identical content to the first version in the new format,
# including the new update client needed to understand the new format.
#
# Clients must be able to update to the latest version in their format using
# the update metadata it understands. Once it is on that version it should also
# be on the new format. To achieve this the following steps must be taken.
