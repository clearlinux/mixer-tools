.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmixer [subcommand] <flags>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmixer\fP(1) is a software update generator that uses input RPMs and bundle
definition files to create update metadata consumable by \fBswupd\fP(1).
.sp
\fBmixer\fP operates in a mix workspace using configuration files existing in the
workspace. The tool allows users to use RPMs from an upstream URL (default
download.clearlinux.org), provide their own RPMs, and use RPMs from other remote
repositories to build updates. Users can also define their own local bundle
definitions as well as use the default bundle definitions from the upstream URL.
.sp
\fBmixer\fP provides commands to manage local RPMs and bundle definitions and
configure remote RPM repositories.
.sp
The output of \fBmixer\fP is a set of manifests readable by \fBswupd\fP as well as
all the OS content \fBswupd\fP needs to perform its update operations. The OS
content includes all the files in an update as well as zero\- and delta\-packs for
improved update performance. See \fBswupd\fP(1) for more details.
