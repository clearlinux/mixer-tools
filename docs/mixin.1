.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmixin [subcommand] <flags>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmixin\fP(1) is a custom content manager that allows users to add custom local
or remote content to their client systems and still receive updates from their
upstream OS vendor.
.sp
A user can add remote RPM repositories or local RPMs and \fImix\fP them into their
update stream. \fBmixin\fP runs \fBmixer\fP(1) to generate an update locally on the
client systems. The output metadata is then merged with the upstream metadata to
provide a single source of update for \fBswupd\fP(1) to perform updates.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
\fBbuild\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Build a mix from local or remote mix content existing/configured under
\fI/usr/share/mix\fP\&. The output of this command can be used by \fBswupd\fP via
the \fBswupd update \-\-migrate\fP command.

.sp
\fBhelp\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Print help text for any \fBmixin\fP subcommand.

\fBpackage add <package\-name> [\-\-build] [\-\-bundle <name>]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add RPM packages from remote or local repositories for use by mixer\-swupd
integration. This command performs a check to see if the added package
exists in any of the configured repositories. The package is then added to
a custom bundle named after the repo from which the package originated.
.sp
Adding the optional \fI\-\-build\fP flag will run \fBmixin build\fP after adding the
package.
.sp
Adding the option \fI\-\-bundle <name>\fP flag will add the package to \fIname\fP
instead of the repo name.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBrepo\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add, list, remove, or edit RPM repositories to be used by \fBmixin\fP\&. The DNF
configuration that is modified is the configuration that exists in the
\fI/usr/share/mix\fP directory. Commands that write to this configuration will
require root permissions. This command supports the same options as the
\fBmixer repo\fP command. See \fBmixer.repo\fP(1) for more information.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
On success, 0 is returned. A non\-zero return code indicates a failure.
