05-create-mix-with-blended-content
==================================
This test creates a mix version 10 with two blended bundles: an upstream bundle
with a unique package that does not exist upstream added, and a custom bundle 
with a package from upstream added. All upstream bundles have been stripped down
for efficiency and are thus edited local copies.
