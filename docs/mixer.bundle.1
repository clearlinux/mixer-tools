.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmixer bundle [command] [flags]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Performs various configuration actions on upstream and local bundle definition
files. List and validate mix bundles. Validate local bundle definition files.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
\fBadd {bundle} [{bundle}...] [flags]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add local or upstream bundles to your mix by modifying the mix bundles list
at \fI<mixer/workspace>/mixbundles\fP\&. In addition to the global options \fBmixer
bundle add\fP takes the following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-all\-local\fP
.sp
Add all local bundles defined in \fI<mixer/workspace>/local\-bundles\fP to the
mix. This command takes precedence over bundle list.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-all\-upstream\fP
.sp
Add all upstream bundles (cached in \fI<mixer/workspace>/upstream\-bundles\fP
to the mix. This command takes precedence over bundle list.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-c, \-\-config {path}\fP
.sp
Optionally tell \fBmixer\fP to use the configuration file at \fIpath\fP\&. Uses
the default \fIbuilder.conf\fP in the mixer workspace if this option is not
provided.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-git\fP
.sp
Automatically apply a new git commit after modifying the mix bundles list
or bundle definitions. This is useful if your local bundles are kept under
version control.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.sp
Display \fBbundle add\fP help information and exit.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBedit\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Edits local and upstream bundle definition files. This command will locate
the bundle (looking first in local\-bundles, then in upstream\-bundles), and
launch an editor to edit it. If the bundle is only found upstream, the
bundle file will first be copied to your local\-bundles directory for
editing. If the bundle is not found anywhere, a blank template is created
with the correct name. When the editor closes, the bundle file is then
parsed for validity.
.sp
The editor is configured via environment variables. VISUAL takes precedence
to EDITOR. If neither are set, the tool defaults to nano. If nano is not
installed, the tool will skip editing, and act as if \(aq\-\-suppress\-editor\(aq had
been passed.
.sp
Passing \(aq\-\-suppress\-editor\(aq will suppress launching the editor, and will
thus only copy the bundle file to local\-bundles (if it is only found
upstream), or create the blank template (if it was not found anywhere). This
can be useful if you want to add a bundle to local\-bundles, but wish to edit
it at a later time.
.sp
Passing \(aq\-\-add\(aq will also add the bundle(s) to your mix. Please note that
bundles are added after all bundles are edited, and thus will not be added
if any errors are encountered earlier on.
.sp
In addition to the global options \fBmixer bundle edit\fP takes the following
options.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-add\fP
.sp
Add the bundle(s) to your mix after editing.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-c, \-\-config {path}\fP
.sp
Optionally tell \fBmixer\fP to use the configuration file at \fIpath\fP\&. Uses
the default \fIbuilder.conf\fP in the mixer workspace if this option is not
provided.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-git\fP
.sp
Automatically apply a new git commit after modifying the mix bundles list
or bundle definitions. This is useful if your local bundles are kept under
version control.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.sp
Display \fBbundle edit\fP help information and exit.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-suppress\-editor\fP
.sp
Suppress launching editor and only copy to local\-bundles or create a
template for the bundle.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBlist [mix|local|upstream] [flags]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
List the bundles in the mix, the available local bundles, or the available
upstream bundles. In addition to the global options \fBmixer bundle list\fP
takes the following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmix\fP
.sp
List the bundles in the mix.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlocal\fP
.sp
List available locally\-defined bundles.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBupstream\fP
.sp
List available upstream bundles.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-c, \-\-config {path}\fP
.sp
Optionally tell \fBmixer\fP to use the configuration file at \fIpath\fP\&. Uses
the default \fIbuilder.conf\fP in the mixer workspace if this option is not
provided.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.sp
Display \fBbundle list\fP help information and exit.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-tree\fP
.sp
Pretty\-print the bundle list as a tree showing include information.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBremove\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Removes bundles from your mix by modifying the mix bundle list (stored in
the \fI<mixer/workspace>/mixbundles\fP file). The mix bundle list is parsed, the
bundles are removed, and the resultant list is written back out in sorted
order. If bundles do not exist in the mix, they are skipped. In addition to
the global options \fBmixer bundle remove\fP takes the following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-c, \-\-config {path}\fP
.sp
Optionally tell \fBmixer\fP to use the configuration file at \fIpath\fP\&. Uses
the default \fIbuilder.conf\fP in the mixer workspace if this option is not
provided.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-git\fP
.sp
Automatically apply a new git commit after modifying the mix bundles list
or bundle definitions. This is useful if your local bundles are kept under
version control.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.sp
Display \fBbundle remove\fP help information and exit.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-local\fP
.sp
Also remove the bundle file from local\-bundles. This action is
irrevocable.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-mix={bool}\fP
.sp
Remove bundle from the mix bundle list. This defaults to true.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBvalidate\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Checks bundle definition files for validity. Only local bundle files are
checked; upstream bundles are trusted as valid. Valid bundles yield no
output. Any invalid bundles will yield a non\-zero return code.
.sp
Basic validation includes checking syntax and structure, and that the bundle
has a valid name. Commands like \fBmixer bundle edit\fP run basic validation
automatically.
.sp
In addition to the global options \fBmixer bundle remove\fP takes the
following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-all\-local\fP
.sp
Run validation against all local bundles.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-c, \-\-config {path}\fP
.sp
Optionally tell \fBmixer\fP to use the configuration file at \fIpath\fP\&. Uses
the default \fIbuilder.conf\fP in the mixer workspace if this option is not
provided.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.sp
Display \fBbundle validate\fP help information and exit.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-strict\fP
.sp
Perform strict validation to additionally check that the bundle header
fields are parse\-able and non\-empty, and that the header \(aqTitle\(aq is itself
valid and matches the bundle filename.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
On success, 0 is returned. A non\-zero return code indicates a failure.
