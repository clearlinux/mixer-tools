upstream-format-bump
====================
This test attempts to create a mix that crosses an upstream format boundary. It
should stop once versions update is called and notices that a bump is needed,
and build upstream-bump should automatically create the two required bump
builds, leaving mixer.state showing the new format, and upstreamversion
showing the original version the user tried to create.
